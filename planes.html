                <p>We'll start off with something that can practically fit in our living room. We can have our butler Jeeves land this near one of our apartments on 5th avenue. It's a small little thing with a small price tag of $5,000,000. </p>

                <p>Some of our associates believe that we would be peasants if we flew in a tier 1 plane especially with all of the neck-bending we would have to endure in such a tiny plane. Help us live like kings by donating $20,000,000.</p>

                <p>It's always nice to have a backup plane just in case if we had to dispose any planes from our fleet for being dirty or running out of fuel. Having this lovely tier 3 plane can be achieved by donating $50,000,000.</p>
